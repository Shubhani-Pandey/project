 This project “Virtual Health Vitals” Analysis aims at easing up the process of Health examination as it analysis all the vitals of one’s body and through the database 
actually identify the disease at early stages.Its step one into the world of automation where AI and algorithms will actually help us in numerous ways.The project makes 
the assessment easy by using Facial identification and numerous sensors to measures Vitals and further helps in preventing or treating the cause at early stage to 
prevent any major consequences. Also it will help in research purposes the database will be the collection of Various people with different problems and this will help 
medical professionals as well as researchers working on new drugs and vaccines to pick up the pace and increase the efficiency of the Drug. With the help of machine 
learning and open cv with various other sensors the application collectively work to provide as accurate results as possible.
